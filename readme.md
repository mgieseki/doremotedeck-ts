<img align="right" width="200" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4b52009f-38fd-4cab-8f29-2c30d7dfd0fb" />

A Stream Deck plugin designed to send commands to Steinberg's music notation software Dorico via the
WebSocket-based Remote Control API. It is a plain TypeScript variant of
[Doremote Deck](https://github.com/mgieseki/doremote-deck) and does not depend on additional
shared libraries.

The plugin provides the core button actions to communicate with Dorico but does not include
pre-configured Stream Deck profiles, ready-to-use command collections, or button icons.

## Current Functionality
The plugin offers the following actions, which can be assigned to Stream Deck buttons.

#### Connect to Dorico
Starts and stops the connection to Dorico. While the initial connection requires confirmation via a dialog
prompt in Dorico, subsequent connections are automatic because the plugin reuses a stored session token.
If the *Automatically reconnect to Dorico* option is enabled in the button properties, the plugin will
attempt to reconnect in the background without requiring a button press. Once Dorico is running, the
connection is automatically established within a few seconds.

#### Send Command
Sends a specific command, like `Edit.ShowAccidental`, to Dorico. To my knowledge, there is currently no
official documentation for the available Dorico commands. However, you can use the demo applications included
with [Doremote](https://github.com/mgieseki/doremote) to browse and test the commands retrieved through
the API.

Dorico's macro recording feature, accessible via the *Script* menu, is another great way to get familiar
with the syntax. The generated Lua script contains all the necessary commands to reproduce your recorded
actions. Please note that the available command set may vary depending on your Dorico version and edition
(SE, Elements, Pro).

In the button settings, enter the command and its parameters into the designated text field. Parameters are
appended after a question mark (`?`) in any order and must be separated by commas (`,`) or ampersands (`&`),
with no spaces in between. For example:

```
UI.InvokePropertyChangeValue?Type=kNoteAccidentalVisibility_v3,Value=kRoundBrackets
```

#### Send Multiple Commands
Similar to the previous action, this one allows you to send a sequence of multiple commands to Dorico.
Commands are entered into the property inspector's text area and must be separated by semicolons and/or
newlines. If Dorico returns an error for any command in the sequence, execution stops immediately, and the
remaining commands are not sent.
